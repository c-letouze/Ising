# Ising
A Machine Learning project on the Ising model. The main goal is to classify its phases.

## Contents

 - `README.md`: this
 - `buildsets_anti.py`
 - `buildsets_ferro.py`

**Bibliography**
some stuff, including:
- Convolutional Neural Nets, Wikipedia
- Cython 
- ML Review - Datasets Ising MC
- Callbacks in Keras
- DeepLearning workflow
- Number of parameters in CNN
- Cython optimization on the Ising Model
- Optimizing Pyton with numba
- Multiple validation sets with Keras
- Machine Learning phases of matter - Nature Physics
- Statistical Mechanics : Algorithms and Computations
 
**CNN**
- `CNN.py`
- some stuff

**Data_antiferro**
too much stuff

**Data_Mehta**
data for the ferromagnetic samples

**DataSets**
labelled and organized datasets for the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic sets.

**MCSimulation**
 - `antiferromagnetism.py` generates the antiferromagnetic samples
 - `antiferro_plot_matrices.py` picks some samples for plotting
 - `generate_samples.py` an old trial on the ferromagnetic case
 - `generator.cpp` same as above, with C++
 
 **PCA**
 - `PCA.py` : doing PCA on the ferro and antiferro datasets and classify
 - `temp_prediction_DNN.ipynb` : a Jupyter notebook on the temperature prediction from the PCA
 - `PCA___.out` :  outputs from the PCA script ; n = number of principal components ; 'anti' for the antiferromagnetic dataset
 - `PCA_datasets.pkl`, `PCA_subset.pkl` : convenient pickles for faster run-time
 
**report**
much much stuff
